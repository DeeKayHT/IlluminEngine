IlluminEngine
=============

Despite the fancy name, this project is only intended as an educational exercise for me to learn the following (in order):
* How to program with OpenGL from basic to advanced rendering techniques
* Learn and the ins and outs of a game engine by creating one from scratch

I figure giving it a name would push me to work on this project more than if it had some generic name like "TestProject."

Currently IlluminEngine builds only as a 32-bit application on Windows using Visual Studio 2015.
