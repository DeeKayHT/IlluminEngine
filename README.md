IlluminEngine
=============

Despite its fancy name, this is only intended as an educational exercise for me to learn the following (in order):
* How to program with OpenGL from basic to advanced rendering techniques
* Learn and the ins and outs of a game engine by creating one from scratch

Currently IlluminEngine builds only as a 32-bit application on Windows.
